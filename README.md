3D Minesweeper Game

This is an open-source 3D minesweeper game created using Unity. The game is inspired by the classic minesweeper game, but instead of a 2D grid, the game is played on a 3D cube.
How to Play

The objective of the game is to clear all the cells on the cube that do not contain mines. Each cell may contain a mine or a number that indicates the number of mines in the neighboring cells. To clear a cell, you can left-click on it. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. If the cell does not contain a mine, the number of neighboring mines will be revealed.

To help you identify the mines, you can right-click on a cell to mark it as a mine. If you mark all the mines correctly, you win the game.
Installation

To play the game, you can download the repository and run the executable file. The game is currently available for Windows and MacOS.
Customization

The game is highly customizable, and you can adjust various settings to make the game more challenging or easier. You can adjust the size of the cube, the number of mines, and the difficulty level. You can also choose to play with a timer or without a timer.

Flask 3D Minesweeper Game

This is an open-source implementation of the classic 3D minesweeper game using Flask. The game is played on a 3D cube, and the user can interact with the game through a web interface.
Getting Started

To get started with the game, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. You can install Flask using pip:

pip install flask

Once you have Flask installed, you can run the game by navigating to the repository's root directory and running the following command:

python app.py

This will start the Flask server, and you can access the game by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000.
How to Play

The objective of the game is to clear all the cells on the cube that do not contain mines. Each cell may contain a mine or a number that indicates the number of mines in the neighboring cells. To clear a cell, you can left-click on it. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. If the cell does not contain a mine, the number of neighboring mines will be revealed.

To help you identify the mines, you can right-click on a cell to mark it as a mine. If you mark all the mines correctly, you win the game.
Customization

The game is highly customizable, and you can adjust various settings to make the game more challenging or easier. You can adjust the size of the cube, the number of mines, and the difficulty level.

To adjust the game settings, you can navigate to the settings page by clicking on the "Settings" button in the top menu. From there, you can adjust the game settings and start a new game.

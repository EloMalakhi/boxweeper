<h1> Boxweeper </h1>

This is an open-source implementation of a game
similar to the popular Windows game minesweeper.

This game is implemented in Python and uses flask
to create a dynamic 3D representation of a box system
displayed on a web browser.

<h1>Installing flask</h1>
This game is available for MacOS and Windows
though up to the release of this README.pd it
has only been operated on MacOS.

To get started you must have Python installed
and if you don't have flask installed you can
enter in terminal or Command Prompt:

pip install flask

for the version of this game flask was
alternatively installed by entering

pip3.10 install flask

<h1>Setting up file structure</h1>
The file structure may be in the right order or not.
To be clear, there should be a parent folder wherever
you decide the game to go.

under the parent folder there should be these three
folders: saves, template, static
and these 7 files:
call.py, data_methods.py, define.py, Head_Script.py
save.py, test.py, validate.py

under the templates folder there should be these
8 html pages:
index5.html, index7.html, index8.html, index9.html,
MinesweeperDeath.html, Modes.html, Presets.html,
Presets3.html

under the static folder should be these 5 files:
Cube.css, MD.css, explosion.jpeg, tomb-stone.png,
unclicked.png  (image refined by some other Apple Developer)

under the saves folder should be these 8 files:
CaptionClass.py, PuzzleClass.py, ConstructClass.py,
SetupClass.py, (next 4 contain game saves)
setup.py, puzzle.py, struct.py, captions.py

Here is an overview of the necessary file structure:
(other files that show up aren't necessary)

            > Cube.css
            > MD.css
            > explosion.jpeg

<h1>How to Play</h1>
The goal of the game is to label all the mines and then
hit the confirmation button.
If you got all of them then you win, otherwise you
continue finding them.

How to find the mines.

Each cube has 26 mines around it
9 below, 9 above, and 8 directly beside
when a cube is clicked on it will display
a number on it displaying the amount of mines
touching it.
It is by comparing the different amount of mines
surrounding each cube that you narrow down where
the mines are located.

If you click on a mine then you get a warning
saying strike. Two more clicks on any mine and 
you lose.

when a cube is narrowed down to possibly be a mine
it should be labeled for the game to check later.

The way to label the mines is to right click on them
which will color them black, and then click on them
to make sure they stay marked.

<h1> Customization </h1>
When running the game by opening terminal or 
command-prompt and executing the python script
Head_Script.py, the browser on localhost
(port is found at the bottom inside Head_Script.py)
will display an html form requesting which mode
to play on.

mode #1 allows you to customize the size of the
box that is viewed on the game as well as the size
of the total box defining the puzzle.

mode #2 allows you to customize the puzzle size
restricting the view to 3 by 3 by 3 and gives
you no open block to start on.

mode #3 differs from #2 in that it gives you 
an open starting block that has 0 mines around
so you can expand from there
